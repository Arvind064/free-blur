# free-blur
iPhone app designed to allow users to simply blur faces for free, without requiring a 5* review.

I went to post a photo the other day and realized some strangers' faces were visible in the background. I wanted to blur them, but all the apps I found either didn't work well or required a 5* review or money to complete your image.

Blurring images is not a huge undertaking, so I'm writing this app to give people a 100% free, no strings way to quickly blur images and drop the product into their photo album.

Contributors welcome. Open an issue describing work you'd want to do.

I'll expand this as the project grows.
